# Portfolio Website - Me

Finally made my personal portfolio! The theme I wanted to go with was a 3D asset in the middle taking focus, and since my 3D skills might not be the best, we ended up with a giant smiley face.

A large bulk of this code was written using Claude Code, as I wanted to see how fast I could mix my own skills, my fast-turning ideas, and the convenience of AI. Let me say I was impressed—having fun and enjoying the whole process.

Looking forward to the next iteration of this when Mr. Smiley gets older and I can try out some new front-end design!
