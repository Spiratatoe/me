      description: 'The goal of this project is to create a graphics program using OpenGL to enable walking through a procedurally created virtual world. Our virtual world starts above sea level, and as the user moves, they are introduced to the depths of the ocean. There, one can see and navigate through sea life, including fish, sharks, seaweeds, rocks, caves, and more. This terrain is procedurally created.',

      description: 'Back In Time is a 2D Metroidvania-style platformer that takes players on an adventure through four distinct time periods — the Present Day, Medieval Times, the Prehistoric Age, and the mysterious Pre-Time era. Designed with nostalgic pixel-art visuals, the game combines exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving, where each era presents unique environments, enemies, and time-based mechanics. Players must navigate challenging levels that evolve across timelines, using time manipulation to overcome obstacles and uncover the deeper consequences of altering history.',

The competition featured attack vs. defense matches that tested both engineering insight and analytical thinking. This project involved designing and implementing predictive algorithms to anticipate opponents’ moves and optimize decision-making in real time — turning the game into a battle of strategy, logic, and foresight. Built in Python, the project highlighted skills in algorithm design, game theory, and competitive problem-solving.',
